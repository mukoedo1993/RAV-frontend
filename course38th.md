Using Shorthands for v-bind and v-on
So far (and also for the rest of this course), we used `v-bind`  to bind to HTML attributes and properties and `v-on`  to bind to events.

There are shorthands you can use for these common directives though.

`v-bind:PROPERTY`  => 

`:PROPERTY` 

Example: `v-bind:style="..."`  => `:style="..."` 

`v-on:EVENT`  => `@EVENT` 

Example: `v-on:click="..."`  => `@click="..."`
